## Background & Interests

The natural world has given much to me personally and professionally. I was fortunate to be a kayak guide for several years in Channel Islands National Park, leading visitors through seacaves and interpreting the natural resources of Santa Cruz Island. Mixed with an existing interest in habitat restoration, exposure to Channel Islands National Park's incredible flora and fauna cultivated a desire to work in conservation. Having attended UC Santa Barbara for my undergraduate education, I was already aware of the Bren School and felt further education was a good path to pursue to enhance my skillsets and gain experience in the environmental field.

Outdoor recreation, islands, and birding are my major interests outside of school. Prior to Bren I was able to spend to spend five months traveling New Zealand where I also got to experience work as a dishwasher and a housekeeper.Being back in the Goleta area is made all the better by proximity to Devereux Slough, one of my favorite locations in Santa Barbara County.

## Experience & Projects

Beyond considerable experience in the outdoor recreation field, I have worked in a variety of field work and management positions for habitat restoration and conservation-related projects. I have experience working with invasive species removal and native vegetation restoration at Coal Oil Point Reserve (COPR), the UCSB campus, the Santa Ynez River, the Santa Clara River, Vandenberg Air Force Base, Edwards Air Force Base, Los Padres National Forest, and Angeles National Forest. As a volunteer, I have participated in conservation projects on several Channel Islands.
